 This class manages tracking and uploading work through sessions.

 It does provide two APIs,
    'startTrackerWithAppKey' to configure and start data tracking,
    'trackEvent' to track whatever you like.

 To use this lib, there are some libs/frameworks you need to include:
    AdSupport.framework - To enable the ADID support by Apple,
    CoreTelephony.framework - To get the mobile phone carrier,
    Security.framework - To encrypt data,
    SystemConfiguration.framework - To check network type (wifi or cellular),
    libsqlite3.dylib - To support sqlite,
    libz.dylib - To compress the data before sending.

 Also, this SDK adopt ARC, make sure your compiler support it.

 Tracking functionality provided by this lib should be activated by this method.

 @appKey The unique key for each application, you can get it from our web system.
 @appVersion Current version of the application using this SDK.
 @appChannel Release channel of the application using this SDK.
 
 Options:
 @isAutoUpload Set it to NO if you don't want SDK sends data automatically.
               You should manually call upload() method.
 @sendOnWifi Set it to YES if you want SDK sends data only when WIFI is on,
             doing this will delay the server to receive data, do not recommend.
 @udid Device UDID of Apple or anything you set as an unique identifier.
         This SDK doesn't collect device UDID due to Apple's policy,
         but you can still set it manually in this interface.
         Please be careful, doing this might make your App rejected by AppStore.
